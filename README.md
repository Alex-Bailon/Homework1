# Code Refactor
# Northwestern Coding BootCamp

# Summary

This is the first assignment for Northwesterns coding bootcamp. For this assignmen we were instructed to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible.
Given the code I was able to make the webpage accessible by doing the following:
* Changed the title of the page from "website" to the companies name "Horiseon"
* Changed all div elements to the appropriate HTML semantic elements(ie: header, nav, section, footer)
* Added alt attributes to all image elements
* Insured all heading attributes fell in sequential oreder.
* On the style sheet, changed any div style to the corresponding HTML semantic elements

# Conclusion

When the webpage is deployed everything is up and running. Possible future goals for this webpage would be to make the webpage mobile friendly. While using the inspection tool noticed that the page was not mobile friendly.
